Circularly permuted group II introns (CP introns) consist of rearranged structural domains separated by two tethered exons, generating branched introns and circular exons via back-splicing. Structural and mechanistic understanding of circular RNA (circRNA) generation by CP introns remains elusive. We resolve cryo-electron microscopy structures of a natural CP intron in different states during back-splicing at a resolution of 2.5–2.9 Å. Domain 6 (D6) undergoes a conformational change of 65° after branching, to facilitate 3′-exon recognition and circularization. Previously unseen tertiary interactions compact the catalytic triad and D6 for splicing without protein, whereas a metal ion, M35, is observed to stabilize the 5′-exon during splicing. While these unique features were not observed in canonical group II introns and spliceosomes, they are common in CP introns, as demonstrated by the cryo-EM structure of another CP intron discovered by comparative genomics analysis. Our results elucidate the mechanism of CP intron back-splicing dynamics, with potential applications in circRNA research and therapeutics.
